# PCOS-CLASSIFICATION:
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a health problem that affects women of childbearing age. Women with PCOS have a hormonal 
imbalance and metabolism problems that may affect their overall health.
This project tries to make a prediction that weather a woman has pcos or not after analysing certain body features.
I have implemented a Machine Learning model for diagnosis of PCOS in women using Random forest algorithm with 90% accuracy.
